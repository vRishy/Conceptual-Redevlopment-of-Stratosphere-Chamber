# Conceptual-Redevlopment-of-Stratosphere-Chamber-in-Brooklands-Museum-Weybridge

The project involves the conceptual redevelopment of the Stratosphere chamber into a community centre.
The Stratosphere chamber currently has collection of aero engines ranging from the simplest early piston engines up to advanced turbofan jet engines and, in the chamber itself, the forward section of Vickers Vanguard airliner just as it could have been seen on test in the test in 1950s.
The Stratosphere chamber is currently visited by tourists and visitors. 
The proposal plan is to build a  ice rink at ground level for ice skating and a state of the art restaurant at the first level with a glass floor and a state of the art infinity swimming pool at the top level with a roof garden on the old stratosphere chamber building in Brooklands, Weybridge.

Autodesk Revit was used throughout the project to design and create the 3D model of the building. 
This allowed to visualize and analsze the structure's feasibility and functionality before construction began. 
The software also helped to identify potential design flaws and allowed for changes to be made before construction, thus minimizing errors and reducing construction costs.

The project was planned with sustainability in mind, incorporating the use of eco-friendly materials and technologies, as well as ensuring energy efficiency throughout the building's operations.
The project plan, vision, stakeholder analysis, requirement elicitation was carried out along with budget estimation and risk analysis in all fields. 
As a conceptual redevelopment project, the proposed design for the Stratosphere Chamber of the Brooklands Museum, Weybridge, England  serves as a study or proposal for potential future development.
While the building was not constructed in real life, the project plan, including the use of sustainable features, job roles, budget, timeline, risk management, stakeholder management, and compliance with planning legislation, was developed and can be used as a guide for future development projects.
